```

### 3. Start the Agent System

```bash
./scripts/start-agents.sh
```

## Core Concepts

### Agent-Native Development
Instead of traditional development where you write code first, you start with agents:

1. **Define Intent**: What do you want to achieve?
2. **Activate Agents**: Which agents can help?
3. **Coordinate Work**: How should agents collaborate?
4. **Learn & Iterate**: How do agents improve over time?

### The 300+ Agent Ecosystem

#### Development Agents
- `ios-developer`: Swift/SwiftUI native development
- `backend-architect`: API and system design
- `fullstack-developer`: End-to-end application development
- `security-auditor`: Code security and vulnerability assessment

#### AI/ML Specialists
- `ai-engineer`: LLM applications and RAG systems
- `ml-engineer`: Model training and deployment
- `prompt-engineer`: LLM prompt optimization
- `data-scientist`: Analytics and insights

#### Business Intelligence
- `tree-analysis-specialist`: Forestry business intelligence
- `business-analyst`: Metrics and KPIs
- `market-research-analyst`: Competitive analysis

#### Research Teams
- `academic-researcher`: Scholarly research and analysis
- `technical-researcher`: Code and implementation analysis
- `research-orchestrator`: Multi-phase research coordination

## Project Type Configurations

### TreeAI/Forestry Projects
Focus on AI-powered tree service management:
- AFISS assessments
- PpH pricing calculations
- DOCS workflow automation
- TreeScore optimization

```bash
# Initialize TreeAI project
./scripts/init-project.sh --type treeai --name "MyTreeBusiness"

# Activate forestry specialists
./scripts/activate-agents.sh tree-analysis-specialist forestry-business-analyst pricing-optimization-agent
```

### iOS/Swift Development
Native Apple ecosystem applications:
- SwiftUI modern patterns
- Claude API integration
- Core Data persistence
- App Store deployment

```bash
# Initialize iOS project
./scripts/init-project.sh --type ios --name "MyiOSApp"

# Activate iOS development team
./scripts/activate-agents.sh ios-developer mobile-developer ui-ux-designer
```

### Next.js/Convex SaaS
Real-time SaaS applications:
- Vertical slice architecture
- Clerk authentication
- Multi-platform support
- Real-time synchronization

```bash
# Initialize SaaS project
./scripts/init-project.sh --type nextjs --name "MySaaSApp"

# Activate full-stack team
./scripts/activate-agents.sh fullstack-developer backend-architect ui-ux-designer
```

### Multi-Agent Systems
CrewAI orchestration platforms:
- Democratic decision making
- Agent coordination patterns
- MCP server integration
- Continuous learning

```bash
# Initialize multi-agent project
./scripts/init-project.sh --type multi-agent --name "MyAgentSystem"

# Activate orchestration team
./scripts/activate-agents.sh agent-expert mcp-expert project-supervisor-orchestrator
```

## Basic Workflows

### 1. Code Development
```bash
# Start development with agent assistance
./scripts/dev-session.sh

# Example interaction:
# User: "I need to implement user authentication"
# Framework: Activates security-auditor, backend-architect, fullstack-developer
# Agents collaborate to implement secure auth system
```

### 2. Research & Analysis
```bash
# Start research session
./scripts/research-session.sh

# Example interaction:
# User: "Research the latest trends in AI-powered forestry"
# Framework: Activates research-orchestrator, academic-researcher, tree-analysis-specialist
# Agents conduct comprehensive research with citations
```

### 3. System Architecture
```bash
# Start architecture planning
./scripts/architecture-session.sh

# Example interaction:
# User: "Design a scalable tree assessment system"
# Framework: Activates backend-architect, cloud-architect, database-optimizer
# Agents design comprehensive system architecture
```

## Agent Coordination Patterns

### Democratic Decision Making
When multiple agents have different approaches:
1. Each agent proposes their solution
2. Agents discuss and evaluate options
3. Consensus building through structured dialogue
4. Final decision based on collective assessment

### Specialist Handoffs
Complex tasks flow through multiple specialists:
1. `research-orchestrator` → `academic-researcher` → `technical-researcher`
2. `backend-architect` → `security-auditor` → `database-optimizer`
3. `ui-ux-designer` → `ios-developer` → `mobile-developer`

### Parallel Coordination
Independent aspects of a task run in parallel:
- Frontend and backend development simultaneously
- Security audit while implementing features
- Documentation generation alongside development

## Memory and Learning

### Agent Memory Types
- **Session Memory**: Current conversation context
- **Project Memory**: Project-specific patterns and decisions
- **Domain Memory**: Specialist expertise and best practices
- **Global Memory**: Cross-project learning and insights

### Continuous Learning
Agents improve through:
- Pattern recognition in successful workflows
- Learning from user feedback and corrections
- Sharing knowledge between related agents
- Adapting to new technologies and best practices

## Configuration

### Environment Setup
```bash
# Copy environment template
cp .env.example .env

# Add your API keys
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_claude_api_key
GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token
```

### Agent Configuration
```yaml
# config/agents.yaml
agents:
  ios-developer:
    priority: high
    memory_size: large
    tools: [xcode, swift, anthropic]
  
  tree-analysis-specialist:
    priority: high
    memory_size: medium
    tools: [calculations, business-logic, reporting]
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
