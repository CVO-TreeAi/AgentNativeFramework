# AgentNativeFramework

A unified agentic framework designed for seamless multi-project workflows. Built to scale and adapt with your development needs across different projects without requiring framework changes.

## Vision

Create a single, coherent agentic solution that:
- Scales with your workflow as projects grow
- Maintains agent capabilities across different project types
- Provides consistent agent coordination patterns
- Supports 300+ specialized agents in a unified architecture

## Architecture Overview

The AgentNativeFramework is built on the principle of **agent-native development** where:
- Agents are first-class citizens in the development process
- Multi-agent coordination is seamless and democratic
- Agent memory and learning persist across projects
- Framework adapts to project requirements without changing core patterns

## Core Components

- **Agent Registry**: Centralized catalog of 300+ specialized agents
- **Coordination Engine**: Democratic multi-agent decision making
- **Memory System**: Persistent agent knowledge and learning
- **Project Adapters**: Framework interfaces for different project types
- **Workflow Orchestration**: Seamless agent handoffs and collaboration

## Getting Started

```bash
# Clone the framework
git clone https://github.com/[username]/AgentNativeFramework.git
cd AgentNativeFramework

# Initialize for your project type
./scripts/init-project.sh [project-type]

# Start the agent coordination system
./scripts/start-agents.sh
```

## Project Types Supported

- **TreeAI/Forestry**: AI-powered business management and pricing
- **iOS/Swift**: Native Apple ecosystem development
- **Next.js/Convex**: Real-time SaaS applications
- **Multi-Agent Systems**: CrewAI orchestration platforms
- **Cross-Platform**: Unified agent coordination

## Agent Categories

- **Development**: ios-developer, backend-architect, fullstack-developer
- **AI/ML**: ai-engineer, ml-engineer, prompt-engineer
- **Security**: security-auditor, mcp-security-auditor
- **Research**: academic-researcher, technical-researcher
- **Business**: business-analyst, market-research-analyst
- **Operations**: devops-engineer, database-optimizer

## Framework Principles

1. **Agent-First Design**: Every workflow starts with agent capabilities
2. **Democratic Coordination**: Agents collaborate on decisions
3. **Persistent Learning**: Knowledge accumulates across projects
4. **Seamless Scaling**: From single agent to 300+ coordination
5. **Project Agnostic**: Framework adapts to any development context

## Contributing

The framework is designed to grow with contributions of new agents, coordination patterns, and project adapters.
