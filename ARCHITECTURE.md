# AgentNativeFramework Architecture

## Core Design Principles

### 1. Agent-Native Development
The framework treats agents as first-class citizens in the development process:
- Every operation can be agent-assisted or agent-driven
- Agents maintain persistent memory across sessions
- Multi-agent coordination is built into the core architecture
- Democratic decision-making among agent collectives

### 2. Unified Workflow Abstraction
A single framework that adapts to different project types:
- Project-agnostic agent capabilities
- Consistent coordination patterns across domains
- Seamless context switching between projects
- Unified agent registry and management

## Agent Registry System

### Agent Classification
- **Tier 1**: Core framework agents (orchestration, memory, coordination)
- **Tier 2**: Domain specialists (iOS, web, AI/ML, security)
- **Tier 3**: Task-specific agents (code-review, testing, deployment)
- **Tier 4**: Business domain agents (TreeAI, finance, operations)

### Agent Capabilities
Each agent provides:
- **Core Function**: Primary capability and expertise area
- **Tools**: Available tools and integrations
- **Memory**: Persistent knowledge and learning
- **Coordination**: How it works with other agents
- **Triggers**: When and how it's activated

## Coordination Engine

### Democratic Decision Making
- Agents propose solutions and vote on approaches
- Consensus building through agent communication
- Conflict resolution through specialist mediation
- Learning from collective decision outcomes

### Workflow Orchestration
- Task decomposition across multiple agents
- Parallel agent execution with coordination
- Sequential handoffs between specialized agents
- Quality gates and validation checkpoints

## Memory System

### Agent Memory Types
- **Working Memory**: Current task context and state
- **Project Memory**: Project-specific knowledge and patterns
- **Domain Memory**: Specialized expertise and best practices
- **Global Memory**: Cross-project learning and insights

### Knowledge Persistence
- Agent learning accumulates across sessions
- Pattern recognition improves over time
- Best practices emerge from agent experience
- Knowledge sharing between related agents
